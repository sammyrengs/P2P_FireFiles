# P2P_FireFiles

This Repository is for Peer-to-peer Web App Firefiles built during the IE 2023 Project.

## About

File transfer is a very essential part of the internet landscape. The aim of this project is to introduce mentees to networking and socket programming by making them explore the peer to peer model of file transfer as opposed to the traditional client-server model.

## Why This Project?
Traditional file transfer involves the client-server model where multiple clients can request services which are later fulfilled by the server. Peer-to-peer file transfer is a decentralized approach which avoids too much load on the server by allowing all nodes to act as clients and servers. Nodes can request services from each other so if the node that originally hosted the file is down, the file still exists on the network if any other node downloaded it.
Understanding peer-to-peer networking is of significant importance due to its vast applications in content delivery, file sharing networks, multimedia, Bitcoin, etc.
