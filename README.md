# P2P_FireFiles

This Repository is for Peer-to-peer Web App Firefiles built during the IE 2023 Project.

## About

File transfer is a very essential part of the internet landscape. The aim of this project is to introduce mentees to networking and socket programming by making them explore the peer to peer model of file transfer as opposed to the traditional client-server model.

## Why This Project?
Traditional file transfer involves the client-server model where multiple clients can request services which are later fulfilled by the server. Peer-to-peer file transfer is a decentralized approach which avoids too much load on the server by allowing all nodes to act as clients and servers. Nodes can request services from each other so if the node that originally hosted the file is down, the file still exists on the network if any other node downloaded it.
Understanding peer-to-peer networking is of significant importance due to its vast applications in content delivery, file sharing networks, multimedia, Bitcoin, etc.

## Libraries/Softwares Used

##React

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
